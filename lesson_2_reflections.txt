What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden "git" folder is created. This needs to be done so that the future changes in the files can
be tracked and stored in the git folder.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do
you think it offers?

The staging area differs from the working directory in that feature of Git that lets you choose
which files to add to the repository, and prepare which files to commit instead of commiting all
the files in the working directory. It is also different from the repository, since it is a
temporary directory where the files to commit are stored, before making changes to the repository,
where the files that are commited are stored and tracked.
