When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Especially when collaborating with several people, or when using several computers to work.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

An automatic pull might overwrite a previous version of a file that you still need, or you might
want to wait until several changes accumulate.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of 
another?

Forks are clones of other repositories inside Github, done directly inside the Github website.
Clone are copies of a repository in Github done to your computer (local copy).
Branches refer to different versions of the files in your repository that will have different
content since the commit where the branch was made. These branches can later be merged to the
master branch or another branch, in order to combine the content of both versions.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It gives you the chance to compare the changes in the remote copy and your local copy, and decide
which changes to keep and how to merge them, in case commits were made both locally and remotely
before syncing the two versions.
