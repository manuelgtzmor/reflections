When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Especially when collaborating with several people, or when using several computers to work.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

An automatic pull might overwrite a previous version of a file that you still need, or you might
want to wait until several changes accumulate.
